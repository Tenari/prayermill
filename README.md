- anyone can drop in a prayer request
- there are a series of perma-requests
- there is a "prayer meeting" button
  - it gives short instructions, and randomly selects a few perma-requests and a few specific requests and presents them for the meeters to pray over.
- specific requests "disappear" after being prayed for
- i think account-less this can work fine, but maybe give option for making account in order to track what you have prayed for + option for seeing when someone prays for your requests.

The tried and true **methods** for growing in your relationship to God:

- prayer
- fasting
- almsgiving
- spiritual and corporal works of mercy
- devotionals
- pilgrimages
- studying
- the sacraments

A periodized religious approach would involve first implementing a minimum baseline of effort. Keep in mind, the goal is to grow a RELATIONSHIP, but like all relationships, it takes work.

The baseline:
- prayer
  - daily prayer of at least 20mins
- fasting
  - friday meat abstinence
- almsgiving
  - weekly/monthly contribution to your parish
- the sacraments
  - Sunday + holy days mass attendance
  - monthly confession

If you do not have your baseline in place, attempting periodized focus is probably not going to be the best place to make gains since after the focus, you'll have no solid habits to fall back on.

Then I suggest making monthly "training blocks" that focus on one method.

prayer block:

week 1
  add 1 minute per day of prayer in the morning, jumping to 30 mins daily by end
week 2
  keep morning prayer to 30m, add examen prayer at night, initial timer from 3 to 10 min daily 1m increase
week 3
  keep morning 30m, examen 10m, add timer to say a jesus prayer throughout day, shrinking down to 1hr intervals
week 4

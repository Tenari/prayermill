anyone can drop in a prayer request
there are a series of perma-requests
there is a "prayer meeting" button
  it gives short instructions, and randomly selects a few perma-requests and a few specific requests and presents them for the meeters to pray over.
specific requests "disappear" after being prayed for
i think account-less this can work fine, but maybe give option for making account in order to track what you have prayed for + option for seeing when someone prays for your requests.
